## Hei! 

I'm Tini, a computer science student at the University of Oslo in Norway.

Specifically in my last year of the bachelor Informatics: Programming and Systems Architecture.

My main tech stack is Java, Kotlin, Scheme and Python. 

Started being interested in coding from making themes and layouts in the game goSupermodel and tumblr as a child, and here I am :D
Dropped out of medicine after three years, built my own pc, and pursued coding.
